1. Write a function that takes in a list of integers as an argument
and returns true if it contains two integers that are the same, false
otherwise.

The first solution has a greater complexity than the first, since we have two nested loops. Perhaps the first solution
maybe be better in a situation where the set data structure is for some reason not available.
